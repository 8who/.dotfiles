# .dotfiles
All of my macOS dotfiles for a nice and clean programming workflow.

# More info on my setup
I have always been a fan of macOS for it's clean UI, vast community and the unix-based system, sorry windows (not really).

# Window Manager
I also got introduced to the world window managers pretty early in my tech journey, so Aerospace on macOS is one of the
best things I think my setup has that I can literally not live without.

# Neovim
In my early days, I was starting out to program python and didn't really control the machine or system pretty well, so I was a little confused
on how the terminal works, why it's important, what even were dotfiles, and why would you even use NVIM over something like JetBrains' PyCharm?
Once I spend like an entire month trying to figure out why NVIM was worth it, I couldn't go back, like ever. And customizing it is pretty fun in 
of itself.

# Tmux
I started out only using tmux's windows, when I realized that one pane per window was too much space for one process or thing I'm currently doing.
An even more eye-opening thing I learned pretty late in my tmux usage, was the fact that you could detach and have a completely different workspace
if things ever get too cluttered up, and even ssh'ing from another machine with any session running on the host.
